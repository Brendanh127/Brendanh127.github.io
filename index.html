        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>How's it going? My name is Brendan Hamadou. I am a 16 year old born and raised in Uptown Manhattan. Growing up, I was really interested in flash games, the content of the games just fascinated me at the time and will always hold a special place in my heart. Those games were just one of my interests as a kid. As a student who attends The Urban Assembly Gateway School for Technology, my focus is currently Information Technology. I.T has a variety of things to learn. While in High School, I've learned a lot about the Fundementals of I.T, Social Engineering, Kryptology, and Networking. Despite my knowledge on these topics, I would like to expand my knowledge as I go on to college. Aside from technology, I am very experienced when it comes to debating and public speaking. In middle school, I participated in the Urban Debate League where I would comepete in competitions all around New York City. My end goal is undetermined at the moment because there's so many things that interests me as explaned previously, which is why I want to go to college. My plan is to find my passion because I want a career not a job. I want to be able to do something I love for a living which I know will take a long time. However, I am willing to trust the process and take any opportunities I can.  </p>

        <p> I am really into Anime. I just love the diversity in it and despite it just being shows, you can learn a lot from them. My favorite Anime of all time would have to be Yu Yu Hakusho, with Soul Eater right trailing right behind it. Yu Yu Hakusho is great because the characters developed so much as time progressed in the show. Soul Eater is the Anime that got me into the genre so it holds a special place in my heart. I just love how different the characters are from other Anime. Of course I have watched other Anime such as Parasyte, Hunter x Hunter, Naruto, Black Lagoon, One Punch Man, and many more. Anime is what helped me through difficult times and without it, I wouldn't be who I am today.</p>

        <h3>Debating/Public Speaking</h3>
        <p> Debating is something that I loved for a long time. I started to grow an intrest in it way back in middle school. I remember back in 6th grade I was reccomended for the Debate Team. I was really upset because I didn't know anything about debate at the time and it was a upperclassmen thing so me and my friend were the only 6th graders on the team. After I started getting a feel for debate and going to tournaments, I realized that I was good at public speaking and it's a fun thing to do. I love the Idea of sharing my knowledge and impressing people. Once High School came around, I took any chance I got in debating and I eventually found one. I was able to debate at Columbia University back in 2019 and managed to get 2nd place only losing by .05 points. It's crazy to think that I started from hating debate to it being something I enjoy doing.</p>

        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <p>I've been around video games all my life and it's not stopping anytime soon. I grew up playing games mostly on the Nintendo D.S, D.S.I, Wii, and the Xbox 360(Even though PlayStation is way better). The games I played on them are still very Nostalgic to me and they all hold a special place in my heart. For example: I love Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games, that game will always be amazing in my eyes. I grew up playing lots of Sonic and Mario games. Nowadays I play games on my ps4 and PC. I play games like Valorant, Gang Beasts, GTA V, Spiderman, Red Dead 2, and many more games. I also have a soft spot for old school video games. Video Game History really interests me as well. There's just something about it that just makes me want to go back in time and play those games while the hype was still present.
